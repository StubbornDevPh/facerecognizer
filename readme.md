INSTRUCTIONS

first things first install python 3
I recommend python 3.6.8 (make sure to add to path)

this is an implementation of opencv,python and pyqt5
in order to run this you show know how to activate virtual environments
on windows use ./env/Scripts/activate
if there is an (env) tag on the cmd then you are doing the right thing

open command prompt and navigate to the project folder and type in:
python main.py
do the registration
do the login
